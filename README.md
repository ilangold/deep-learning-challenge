Non-profit funding deep learning classifier - Module 21 challenge

This repository contains files for classifying non-profit organizations as successful or unsuccessful. The models are all built with TensorFlow using neural networks to predict whether the organizations are successful or not. The initial model is saved in the "initial_modeling.ipynb" notebook. Successive model optimization attempts are saved under the "model_optimization_'n'.ipynb" notebooks. Each model is then saved to a corresponding "CharitySuccessModel.h5" HDF5 file.
